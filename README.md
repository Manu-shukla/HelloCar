# HelloCar
• Hello Car is an IoT based project where one car which is passing by another car can communicate through sensors and bluetooth/WiFi technology.

• Here, we are making a robot which has the chesis just like the car and using embedded C to code for the UV sensor and IR censors to get the distance between 2 cars travelling.

• The parts that we are using are-
1. Wooden Plank Chesis.
2. Arduino Uno Rev3
3. AC Geared Motor 60RPM 25W 
4. Ultraviolet UV Detection Sensor Based on GUVA-S12SD 240nm-370nm
5. 5V Relay Module Expansion Board for Arduino
6. Robot Wheel-3 (10cm x 2cm)
7. IR Sensor Module
